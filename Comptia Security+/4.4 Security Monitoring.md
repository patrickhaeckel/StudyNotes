### **Monitoring Computing Resources**

- **Systems:**
    
    - Monitoring authentications and logins.
    - Viewing account access and understanding login locations (e.g., unexpected logins from other countries).
    - Monitoring systems for software versions and patch requirements.
- **Applications:**
    
    - Checking application availability and ensuring they remain operational.
    - Monitoring traffic for unusual patterns, such as data exfiltration.
    - Keeping communication open with software developers for updates on vulnerabilities.
- **Infrastructure:**
    
    - Monitoring remote access systems (e.g., VPNs).
    - Logging activity from firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other devices.
    - Consolidating log files into a Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM).

### **Activities**

- **Log Aggregation:**
    
    - Centralizing diverse logs from systems like firewalls, switches, and servers into a SIEM.
- **Alerting:**
    
    - Notifying in real-time about unusual activities like failed authentications or data transfer anomalies.
    - Sending alerts via text messages or emails for immediate response.
- **Scanning:**
    
    - Continuously scanning devices for vulnerabilities and gathering metrics like operating system versions and application statuses.
- **Reporting:**
    
    - Creating actionable reports on vulnerabilities, compliance, and potential anomalies.
    - Generating ad hoc reports for "what if" scenarios and future planning (e.g., end-of-life system risks).
- **Archiving:**
    
    - Maintaining long-term data backups for security and compliance purposes.
    - Using archived logs to investigate long-term attacker presence in networks.
- **Alert Response and Remediation/Validation:**
    
    - **Quarantine:**
        - Isolating compromised systems to prevent further access or lateral movement.
    - **Alert Tuning:**
        - Adjusting alerts to minimize false positives and false negatives, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

### **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**

- **Purpose:** Consolidates vulnerability descriptions into a common language across different tools, enabling seamless communication and automation.
- **Use Case:** A next-generation firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), and vulnerability scanner may identify the same issue but describe it differently. SCAP harmonizes these descriptions.
- **Benefits:** Automates vulnerability detection and patching across large-scale networks with minimal manual intervention.

* * *

### **Benchmarks**

- **Definition:** Secure baselines or best practices for configuring operating systems, applications, and devices.
- **Example:** A benchmark for mobile devices might enforce encryption, block screenshots, and disable screen recordings.
- **Source:** Provided by organizations like the Center for Internet Security (CIS).
- **Purpose:** Ensures systems are configured securely right out of the box.

### **Agent-Based vs. Agentless Monitoring**

- **Agent-Based:**
    - **Description:** Software installed on a device to monitor continuously.
    - **Advantage:** Always running and monitoring for compliance.
    - **Maintenance:** Requires updates to the agent and security configurations.
- **Agentless:**
    - **Description:** Runs without installation, typically on-demand or during specific events like VPN logins.
    - **Advantage:** No maintenance required.
    - **Limitation:** Not active continuously; requires manual or scheduled execution.

### **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**

- **Purpose:** Centralizes log collection from diverse tools, such as firewalls and VPN concentrators.
- **Capabilities:**
    - Consolidation and correlation of logs from multiple sources.
    - Long-term storage for forensic analysis.
    - Reporting and alert generation for suspicious activities.
- **Example:** Correlates VPN login activity with firewall logs for security insights.

### **Antivirus and Anti-Malware**

- **Definition:** Tools to detect, block, and remove malicious software like viruses, worms, and ransomware.
- **Interchangeable Terms:** The terms "antivirus" and "anti-malware" are often used synonymously today.
- **Use:** Provides endpoint protection by identifying and neutralizing threats.

* * *

### **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**

- **Purpose:** Monitors and blocks the transfer of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or medical data, over the network.
- **Deployment:**
    - Endpoint DLP: Protects data on devices.
    - Cloud-Based DLP: Monitors data in cloud environments.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Ensures sensitive information is not leaked intentionally or unintentionally.

* * *

### **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and SNMP Traps**

- **SNMP:**
    - **Use:** Monitors and collects device metrics (e.g., bandwidth usage, packet counts).
    - **Operation:** Uses a Management Information Base (MIB) to store and query device-specific metrics.
- **SNMP Traps:**
    - **Proactive Alerts:** Sends alerts to the management station when preconfigured thresholds are exceeded.
    - **Example:** Notifying administrators if CRC errors on a server increase.

* * *

### **NetFlow**

- **Purpose:** Collects detailed traffic flow data for analysis.
- **Components:**
    - **Probe:** Gathers traffic data.
    - **Collector:** Aggregates and reports data.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Identifying top network conversations.
    - Monitoring application traffic flows.
    - Enhancing visibility into network behavior.

### **Vulnerability Scanners**

- **Function:** Identifies potential vulnerabilities without exploiting them.
- **Capabilities:**
    - Scans for open ports and services.
    - Evaluates system configurations for weaknesses.
    - Generates reports categorizing vulnerabilities (e.g., critical, medium, low).
- **Routine Use:** Regular scans help maintain compliance and reduce risk exposure.
