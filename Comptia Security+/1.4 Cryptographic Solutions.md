### **Obfuscation**

- **Steganography**:
    
    - Hiding data within media like images, audio, video, or network traffic.
    - Examples:
        - Information hidden in yellow printer dots (machine identification codes).
        - Messages embedded within TCP packets or an image's metadata.
    - Known as "security through obscurity," with reversible hiding methods.
- **Tokenization**:
    
    - Replaces sensitive data with tokens.
    - Example:
        - Credit card numbers replaced with one-time-use tokens during transactions.
        - Prevents reuse of sensitive information by attackers.
    - Enables secure data transfer without encryption.
- **Data Masking**:
    
    - Hides portions of sensitive data while preserving usability.
    - Examples:
        - Credit card numbers on receipts showing only the last four digits.
        - Rearranging or replacing data in a reversible format.
        - Used in customer service to protect sensitive information.

### **Hashing, Salting, Digital Signatures, Key Stretching, Blockchain, and Open Public Ledger**

- **Hashing**:
    
    - A cryptographic process that converts data into a fixed-length string of text, referred to as a message digest or fingerprint, ensuring **integrity** by verifying that data has not been altered.
    - Commonly used to verify file integrity (e.g., comparing downloaded files with hashes) and to store passwords securely by transforming them into hashes.
    - Algorithms like **SHA256** produce unique hashes, while outdated ones like **MD5** are prone to collisions.
- **Salting**:
    
    - Enhances password security by adding a unique, random string to each password before hashing it, preventing attacks like rainbow table lookups.
    - Salts ensure that even identical passwords have distinct hashes, making it harder for attackers to brute force or reverse-engineer passwords.
- **Digital Signatures**:
    
    - Provides **authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation** by validating the sender and confirming that a message or document has not been altered.
    - Utilizes cryptographic keys where the sender encrypts a hash of the message with their **private key**, and the recipient uses the sender’s **public key** to verify it.
    - Commonly applied in emails, contracts, and digital documents for validation.
- **Key Stretching**:
    
    - A method to make passwords more resistant to brute force attacks by applying computationally intensive hashing algorithms multiple times (e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt).
    - This process significantly slows down the brute-forcing of passwords, increasing security.
- **Blockchain**:
    
    - A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in blocks linked together via cryptographic hashes.
    - Each participant maintains a copy of the ledger, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized modifications.
    - Widely used for applications like **cryptocurrency, supply chain tracking, digital identity management, and voting systems**.
- **Open Public Ledger**:
    
    - A core feature of blockchain where all transactions are visible to participants, ensuring transparency and trust.
    - Changes are verified collectively, and any tampering invalidates the affected blocks, maintaining the integrity of the system.

### **Certificates**

- **Digital Certificates**:
    
    - Serve as digital identification cards containing public keys and digital signatures.
    - Provide authentication and trust in IT security.
- **Certificate Authorities (CA)**:
    
    - Third-party entities that validate and digitally sign certificates.
    - Public CA lists are preloaded into browsers for universal trust.
    - Internal CAs are common for medium-to-large organizations managing internal services.
- **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)**:
    
    - Lists of revoked certificates maintained by CAs.
    - Browsers access these lists via CRL Distribution Points in the certificate details.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**:
    
    - Real-time, efficient protocol for checking certificate validity.
    - OCSP stapling integrates the certificate status into the SSL handshake using CA-signed validation.
- **Self-Signed Certificates**:
    
    - Created without a third-party CA.
    - Suitable for internal systems if the organization’s CA is trusted by all internal devices.
- **Third-Party Trust**:
    
    - Browsers trust websites based on the validation process of external CAs.
    - Websites must undergo verification to ensure ownership and authenticity.
- **Root of Trust**:
    
    - Foundation of trust provided by hardware, firmware, or software (e.g., Secure Enclave or HSMs).
    - Ensures reliable validation of certificates and connections.
- **Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Generation**:
    
    - Combines public keys and identifying information to create a request for CA validation.
    - Includes details such as the server name and organization.
- **Wildcard Certificates**:
    
    - Utilize Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to allow one certificate to secure multiple subdomains.
    - Efficient for managing large numbers of devices under the same domain.
- **Revocation Scenarios**:
    
    - Revoking certificates due to vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed) or compromised servers.
    - Importance of maintaining updated CRLs and ensuring OCSP support.
