**SAST - Static Application Security Testing**Â  is a method of security testing that involves analyzing an application's source code, bytecode, or binary code to identify vulnerabilities without executing the program. It is typically performed early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), allowing developers to detect security flaws in the codebase before the application is deployed.
