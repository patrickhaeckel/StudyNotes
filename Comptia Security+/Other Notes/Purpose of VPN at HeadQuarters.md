The main purpose of employees connecting to a headquarters VPN concentrator serves several critical business needs:

1.  Secure Remote Access to Internal Resources:

- Access internal file servers and databases
- Use internal web applications and tools
- Connect to internal development environments
- Reach printers and other network resources
- Access internal documentation and wikis

2.  Security and Compliance:

- All traffic is encrypted, protecting sensitive company data
- IT can enforce security policies (like forcing antivirus updates)
- Activity can be monitored and logged for compliance
- Access can be quickly revoked if an employee leaves
- Multi-factor authentication can be enforced

3.  Network Control:

- IT can control which resources each employee can access
- Traffic can be inspected for malware and threats
- Bandwidth usage can be monitored and controlled
- Network policies can be consistently applied
- Geographic access restrictions can be enforced

4.  Cost and Resource Management:

- Licenses for internal software can be controlled
- Network resources can be allocated efficiently
- Internet bandwidth can be centrally managed
- IT support can be streamlined
- Infrastructure costs can be consolidated

For example: An employee working from home needs to access the company's internal development servers, and customer database. They connect to the VPN concentrator, which:

1.  Authenticates their identity
2.  Creates an encrypted tunnel
3.  Provides access to only the resources they're authorized to use
4.  Monitors for security threats
5.  Logs their activity for compliance

This creates a secure, manageable way for remote employees to work as if they were physically in the office.

## **What a proxy CAN do:**

- Provide access to specific web-based applications
- Enable basic traffic routing and filtering
- Offer some level of anonymity
- Handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic

## **What a proxy CANNOT do:**

1.  Handle non-web protocols

- Can't handle internal file shares (SMB/CIFS)
- No support for legacy applications using custom protocols
- Won't work with internal DNS resolution
- Can't handle printer protocols or local network discovery

2.  Provide full network integration

- Doesn't create a virtual network interface
- No ability to join the internal network directly
- Can't provide a company internal IP address
- Limited ability to access network resources

3.  Offer comprehensive security

- Typically only encrypts web traffic
- No end-to-end encryption for all traffic
- Limited ability to enforce security policies
- Can't provide network-level security features

For example: If an employee needs to:

- Access internal file shares
- Use network printers
- Connect to development environments
- Use internal applications
- Access network resources

A proxy would only handle web-based portions of these needs, while leaving other critical business functions inaccessible. A VPN, on the other hand, creates a complete network integration that makes all these services available securely.

If your needs are limited to just accessing web-based applications, a proxy might be sufficient. However, for full office-like remote work capabilities, a VPN is necessary.
