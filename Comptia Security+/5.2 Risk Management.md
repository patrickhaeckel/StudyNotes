### Risk Management Core Components

- **Risk Identification**:
    - Involves identifying potential threats from both internal and external sources
    - Critical for growing organizations where risk exposure increases with size
    - Requires continuous monitoring and assessment of new and existing threats
    - Forms the foundation of the organization's security posture
- **Risk Assessment Types**:
    - **Ad Hoc Assessments**:
        - Latin phrase meaning "for this purpose only"
        - Created for specific scenarios (e.g., CEO requests after learning about new threats)
        - Usually involves forming temporary committees
        - Disbanded once the specific assessment is complete
    - **Recurring Assessments**:
        - Performed on fixed schedules (quarterly, bi-annual, or annual)
        - May be mandated by compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS)
        - Often conducted internally without third-party involvement
        - Maintains ongoing documentation
    - **One-time Assessments**:
        - Project-specific evaluations
        - Used for special circumstances like mergers and acquisitions
        - Focused on new technology implementations
        - Limited to specific scope and timeframe
- **Risk Analysis Methods**:
    - **Qualitative Analysis**:
        - Uses broad categories (low, medium, high)
        - Often displayed using traffic light grids
        - Evaluates impact, occurrence rate, and control costs
        - Provides high-level view for decision-making
    - **Quantitative Analysis**:
        - **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)**: AV × EF
        - **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)**: ARO × SLE
        - **ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)**: Expected frequency per year
        - Includes precise financial calculations and probabilities
- **Risk Management Tools**:
    - **Risk Register**:
        - Documents individual risks for projects
        - Contains key risk indicators
        - Assigns risk owners
        - Establishes risk thresholds
    - **Risk Tolerance vs Risk Appetite**:
        - **Risk Appetite**: Acceptable risk level
            - Expansionary: Higher risk acceptance
            - Conservative: Lower risk tolerance
            - Neutral: Balanced approach
        - **Risk Tolerance**: Variance above risk appetite
- **Risk Management Strategies**:
    - **Transfer**:
        - Moves risk to another party
        - Often involves cybersecurity insurance
        - Contractual risk transfer
    - **Accept**:
        - **Exemption**: Policy exceptions for specific cases
        - **Exception**: Temporary deviation from security policies
    - **Avoid**:
        - Complete elimination of risk
        - May involve discontinuing risky activities
    - **Mitigate**:
        - Implementation of controls
        - Risk reduction measures
- **Business Impact Analysis Components**:
    - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**:
        - Defines acceptable downtime
        - Sets restoration timeframes
    - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**:
        - Determines acceptable data loss
        - Sets backup requirements
    - **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)**:
        - Average time for problem resolution
        - Includes diagnosis and replacement time
    - **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**:
        - Predicts system reliability
        - Calculated as total uptime divided by breakdown count
