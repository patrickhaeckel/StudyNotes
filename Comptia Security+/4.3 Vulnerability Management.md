### **Identification Methods**

#### **Vulnerability Scan**

- Vulnerability scans identify potential attack vectors without performing an actual exploit.
    - Examples include port scans to identify open and closed ports.
    - Used both externally and internally to identify vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
    - Requires review to verify results and address potential false positives.

### **Application Security**

- **Static Analysis**:
    - Uses Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to analyze source code for vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and SQL injection.
    - Identifies issues during development but may not detect vulnerabilities in implementation, such as weak cryptography.
    - Requires manual review to separate true positives from false positives.
- **Dynamic Analysis**:
    - Also known as fuzzing, it introduces random inputs to an application to observe unexpected behavior, errors, or crashes.
    - Automated tools like CERT's Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF) can test applications at scale.
    - Helps developers strengthen input validation and error handling.
- **Package Monitoring**:
    - Verifies the integrity and trustworthiness of software packages before installation.
    - Encourages testing in isolated environments to detect embedded vulnerabilities or malicious modifications.

### **Threat Feed**

- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**:
    - Aggregates public data from forums, social media, and government publications for threat insights.
    - Useful for tracking hacker group activities and emerging threats.
- **Proprietary/Third-Party Intelligence**:
    - Offers subscription-based intelligence services analyzing attack patterns across organizations.
    - Provides real-time alerts and mitigation strategies for new threats.
- **Information-Sharing Organizations**:
    - Groups like the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) collect and validate threat intelligence from members, scoring threats for severity.
    - Enables collaborative defense against emerging attacks.
- **Dark Web Monitoring**:
    - Investigates activities on the dark web to uncover hacking tools, stolen data, or organizational threats.
    - Monitors forums and marketplaces to preemptively address risks.
