### **Identification Methods**

#### **Vulnerability Scan**

- Vulnerability scans identify potential attack vectors without performing an actual exploit.
    - Examples include port scans to identify open and closed ports.
    - Used both externally and internally to identify vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
    - Requires review to verify results and address potential false positives.

### **Application Security**

- **Static Analysis**:
    - Uses Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to analyze source code for vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and SQL injection.
    - Identifies issues during development but may not detect vulnerabilities in implementation, such as weak cryptography.
    - Requires manual review to separate true positives from false positives.
- **Dynamic Analysis**:
    - Also known as fuzzing, it introduces random inputs to an application to observe unexpected behavior, errors, or crashes.
    - Automated tools like CERT's Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF) can test applications at scale.
    - Helps developers strengthen input validation and error handling.
- **Package Monitoring**:
    - Verifies the integrity and trustworthiness of software packages before installation.
    - Encourages testing in isolated environments to detect embedded vulnerabilities or malicious modifications.

### **Threat Feed**

- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**:
    - Aggregates public data from forums, social media, and government publications for threat insights.
    - Useful for tracking hacker group activities and emerging threats.
- **Proprietary/Third-Party Intelligence**:
    - Offers subscription-based intelligence services analyzing attack patterns across organizations.
    - Provides real-time alerts and mitigation strategies for new threats.
- **Information-Sharing Organizations**:
    - Groups like the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) collect and validate threat intelligence from members, scoring threats for severity.
    - Enables collaborative defense against emerging attacks.
- **Dark Web Monitoring**:
    - Investigates activities on the dark web to uncover hacking tools, stolen data, or organizational threats.
    - Monitors forums and marketplaces to preemptively address risks.

* * *

### **Penetration Testing**

- Simulates real-world attacks to test and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
    - Activities include privilege escalation, password brute-forcing, and social engineering.
    - May use known exploits like buffer overflows or database injections to test defenses.
    - Results often guide corrective actions like patching and updating security controls.
- Follows strict **Rules of Engagement** to define testing scope, times, and systems included or excluded from testing.
    - Ensures minimal disruption to production systems.
- Exploits found during tests may include creating backdoors or establishing proxy systems for lateral movement within the network.

* * *

### **Responsible Disclosure Program**

- Encourages reporting vulnerabilities to developers or manufacturers without public disclosure.
    - Ensures vulnerabilities are addressed through proper patches before being shared widely.
    - Typically involves publishing fixes alongside CVE details.
- **Bug Bounty Program**:
    - Rewards researchers for identifying and responsibly reporting vulnerabilities.
    - Promotes proactive security research and cooperative remediation efforts.

* * *

### **System/Process Audit**

- Audits evaluate the effectiveness of security measures and compliance with regulations.
    - Includes reviewing system configurations, access controls, and incident response processes.
    - Supports continuous improvement by identifying gaps and recommending enhancements.

## Objectives of Vulnerability Management and Remediation

### **Analysis**

- **Confirmation**
    - **False Positives**: Instances where a vulnerability is reported but does not exist on the targeted system.
    - **False Negatives**: Vulnerabilities that exist but are not detected by scanning tools, posing a greater risk than false positives.
- **Prioritize Vulnerabilities**
    - Vulnerabilities should be prioritized based on their severity and potential impact, often determined using standardized scoring systems.
- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**
    - Assigns a severity score from 0 to 10 to vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to prioritize remediation based on criticality.
- **Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)**
    - Standardized identifiers for publicly known vulnerabilities, cross-referenced with databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
- **Vulnerability Classification**
    - Categorizing vulnerabilities by type, severity, and affected systems.
- **Exposure Factor**
    - A percentage estimate of the impact of a vulnerability being exploited, influencing its priority level.
- **Environmental Variables**
    - Contextual factors such as deployment environment (public cloud vs. isolated lab) and system importance.
- **Industry/Organizational Impact**
    - Considering the unique effects vulnerabilities might have based on the organization's sector, e.g., healthcare, energy, etc.
- **Risk Tolerance**
    - Determining the acceptable level of risk for unpatched or partially mitigated vulnerabilities.

### **Vulnerability Response and Remediation**

- **Patching**
    - Regularly scheduled updates or emergency patches for critical vulnerabilities.
- **Insurance**
    - Cybersecurity insurance to mitigate financial losses from vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Segmentation**
    - Network segmentation or air-gapping to limit the scope of potential exploits.
- **Compensating Controls**
    - Alternative measures like firewalls, ACLs, or disabling vulnerable services when patches are unavailable.
- **Exceptions and Exemptions**
    - Structured decisions to delay or forgo patching specific systems due to conflicts or low exploit likelihood.

* * *

### **Validation of Remediation**

- **Rescanning**
    - Conducting post-patch scans to verify vulnerabilities have been resolved.
- **Audit**
    - Random or targeted checks to confirm the effectiveness of patches or compensating controls.
- **Verification**
    - Manual or automated processes to ensure patches were applied successfully and systems are no longer at risk.

* * *

### **Reporting**

- Tracking and summarizing vulnerability management efforts through:
    - The number of identified, patched, and unpatched vulnerabilities.
    - Status of remediation efforts, including failed patches and systems requiring exemptions.
    - Trend analysis of new threat notifications and resolution effectiveness over time.
    - High-level reporting for stakeholders to assess organizational risk and remediation progress.

### Important

1.  **Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives**
    - Update vulnerability scanner signatures regularly.
    - Validate scan results with manufacturers or additional research when discrepancies arise.
2.  **Environment-Specific Responses**
    - Tailor remediation efforts based on the systemâ€™s role and exposure level.
3.  **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
    - Implement a feedback loop through rescanning, audits, and reporting to ensure adaptive and robust vulnerability management.
