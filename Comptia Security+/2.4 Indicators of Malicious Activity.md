### **Malware Attacks**

- **Ransomware**:
    
    - Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
    - Example: WannaCry worm spreading ransomware across networks.
- **Trojan**:
    
    - Disguised as legitimate software but installs malware.
    - Example: A seemingly useful program that secretly installs a backdoor.
- **Worm**:
    
    - Self-replicates without user intervention, spreading across networks.
    - Example: Exploits vulnerabilities like EternalBlue in Windows.
- **Spyware**:
    
    - Secretly gathers user data, including keystrokes and browsing habits.
    - Example: Keyloggers that capture login credentials.
- **Bloatware**:
    
    - Pre-installed software that consumes system resources and may pose security risks.
    - Example: Unwanted trial software on new computers.
- **Virus**:
    
    - Requires user action to spread and infect files or systems.
    - Example: A macro virus embedded in an Office document.
- **Keylogger**:
    
    - Captures every keystroke made on a system, including usernames, passwords, and financial details.
    - Often stores data in a file and sends it to attackers periodically.
    - Can also capture clipboard data, screenshots, instant messages, and search queries.
    - Example: DarkComet RAT, which records keystrokes and user activity.
- **Logic Bomb**:
    
    - Malicious code that triggers when specific conditions are met, such as a date/time or user login.
    - Difficult to detect due to lack of antivirus signatures.
    - Example: March 2013 South Korea attack—triggered on March 20 at 2:00 PM, wiping bank systems and ATMs.
- **Rootkit**:
    
    - Malware that hides within the operating system, often at the kernel level, making it hard to detect.
    - Runs as part of the OS, making traditional antivirus ineffective.
    - Some rootkits operate at the user level and can be detected with specialized removal tools.
    - Prevention: Secure Boot in UEFI BIOS verifies OS integrity before booting.

### **Physical Attacks**

- **Brute Force**:
    - Gaining access through forceful entry, such as breaking doors or windows.
- **RFID Cloning**:
    - Duplicating access cards or key fobs to bypass physical security.
- **Environmental Attacks**:
    - Disrupting infrastructure by cutting power or manipulating HVAC systems to overheat servers.

* * *

## **Network Attacks**

### **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)**:

- **Amplified Attacks**: Sending small requests that generate large responses, overwhelming systems.
- **Reflected Attacks**: Spoofing source IPs so that responses target a victim system.

### **Domain Name System (DNS) Attacks**:

- **DNS Spoofing**: Altering DNS responses to redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Domain Hijacking**: Gaining control of a domain’s registration settings.
- **URL Hijacking (Typosquatting)**: Using misspelled domains to deceive users.

### **Wireless Attacks**

- **Deauthentication Attacks**: A denial-of-service attack that disconnects users from wireless networks.
- **RF Jamming**: Interferes with wireless signals by broadcasting noise on wireless frequencies.
- **Management Frame Vulnerabilities**: Security weaknesses in earlier 802.11 versions that allow attackers to manipulate network communications.

### **On-Path Attacks**

- **ARP Poisoning**: Attacker intercepts traffic between devices on a local subnet.
- **On-Path Browser Attacks**: Malware acts as a proxy on the victim's device.
- **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks**: Captures credentials and can initiate unauthorized sessions.

### **Credential Replay**

- **Pass-the-Hash**: Reuses captured password hashes for authentication.
- **Session Hijacking/Sidejacking**: Captures and reuses session IDs.
- **Cookie Theft**: Stealing browser cookies to reuse session information.

### **Malicious Code**

- **WannaCry Ransomware**: Exploited SMB v1 vulnerability.
- **British Airways Attack**: Used malicious JavaScript for credit card theft.
- **Estonian Central Health Database Breach**: SQL injection attack.
- **Executable, Script, and Trojan Horse Attacks**: Includes various forms of malicious code, such as macro viruses.

* * *

### **Application Attacks**

#### **1\. Injection Attack**

An **injection attack** occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into an input field, allowing unauthorized commands to be executed on a client or server. This happens when an application fails to properly validate user inputs.

- **Example:** SQL injection, where attackers modify a database query to access or manipulate data.
- **Other types:** HTML, XML, LDAP injection.

#### **2\. Buffer Overflow**

A **buffer overflow attack** happens when an attacker sends more data to a memory buffer than it can hold, causing excess data to overwrite adjacent memory. This can crash an application or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

- **Challenges:** Finding a working buffer overflow exploit is difficult because memory allocation varies across applications.

#### **3\. Replay Attack**

A **replay attack** involves capturing network traffic (such as login credentials or session tokens) and retransmitting it to gain unauthorized access.

- **Example:** An attacker intercepts a hashed password and reuses it to log into a system.
- **How it’s done:** Using malware, ARP poisoning, or network sniffing tools.

#### **4\. Privilege Escalation**

Attackers exploit system vulnerabilities to gain higher-level permissions than they were initially granted.

- **Types:**
    - **Vertical privilege escalation:** A regular user gains admin/system-level access.
    - **Horizontal privilege escalation:** A user gains access to another user's account.
- **Example:** CVE-2023-29336 - A vulnerability in the Windows win32k Kernel allowed attackers to obtain **system privileges**.

#### **5\. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)**

An **attacker tricks a user’s browser** into performing unauthorized actions on a trusted website where the user is logged in.

- **How it works:**
    - The attacker sends a **malicious request** (e.g., a fake hyperlink).
    - The victim, already authenticated, unknowingly executes the attacker's command (e.g., transferring funds).
- **Mitigation:** Web applications implement **anti-forgery tokens** to verify legitimate requests.

#### **6\. Directory Traversal Attack**

A **directory traversal attack** exploits **poor web server configurations** to gain unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory.

- **Example:** A hacker inputs `../../windows/system.ini` in a web request to access restricted system files.
- **Indication of attack:** Seeing `../` in a web server log suggests an attacker is checking for vulnerabilities.

### **Cryptographic Attacks**

#### **1\. Birthday Attack**

This attack exploits the mathematical probability that two different inputs can produce the same hash value (hash collision).

- **Concept:** With just **23 people in a room**, there’s a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday. Similarly, attackers try to find **two different plaintexts that create the same hash**.
- **Example:** MD5 hashes were found to be vulnerable to collisions, leading to their deprecation.

#### **2\. Collision Attack**

A **collision attack** occurs when two different inputs produce the same cryptographic hash, making it easier for attackers to forge data.

- **Example:** In 2008, researchers exploited MD5 collisions to create a fake digital certificate, tricking systems into accepting an unauthorized certificate as legitimate.
- **Mitigation:** Use stronger hashing algorithms with **larger hash outputs** (e.g., SHA-256 instead of MD5).

#### **3\. Downgrade Attack**

A **downgrade attack** forces a system to use a weaker encryption algorithm, making it easier for attackers to break encryption.

- **Example:** **SSL stripping**, where an attacker tricks a user’s browser into using HTTP (unencrypted) instead of HTTPS (encrypted).
- **How it works:**
    - The attacker intercepts an initial HTTP request.
    - They prevent the website from redirecting to HTTPS.
    - The victim unknowingly communicates over **unencrypted** HTTP.
    - The attacker captures sensitive data like login credentials.

### **Password Attacks**

- **Spraying**:
    
    - Attackers try a few common passwords across many accounts to avoid detection.
        
    - Avoids account lockouts by limiting the number of attempts per account.
        
- **Brute Force**:
    
    - Attackers systematically attempt every possible password combination.
        
    - Offline brute force attacks use password hash files to guess passwords without triggering account lockouts.

### **Indicators of Compromise**

- **Account Lockout**:
    
    - Occurs after multiple failed login attempts.
        
    - Attackers may trigger this intentionally to impersonate a user when requesting a password reset.
        
- **Concurrent Session Usage**:
    
    - A single user logged in from multiple locations or devices.
        
    - May indicate an attacker has gained unauthorized access.
        
- **Blocked Content**:
    
    - Security updates and antivirus downloads are disabled to maintain attacker access.
- **Impossible Travel**:
    
    - Logins from geographically distant locations in a short period.
        
    - Indicates compromised credentials.
        
- **Resource Consumption**:
    
    - Sudden spikes in network or system activity.
        
    - Often associated with data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
        
- **Resource Inaccessibility**:
    
    - Systems or files become unavailable due to attack activity.
        
    - Can be linked to ransomware or service disruptions.
        
- **Out-of-Cycle Logging**:
    
    - Logs show unexpected system or application updates.
        
    - May indicate unauthorized changes by an attacker.
        
- **Published/Documented Compromise**:
    
    - Sensitive organizational data appears on the internet.
        
    - Often used as leverage in ransomware attacks.
        
- **Missing Logs**:
    
    - Attackers delete security logs to hide their activities.
        
    - Lack of expected log entries is a strong indicator of compromise.
