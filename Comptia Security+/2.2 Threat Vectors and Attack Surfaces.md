### **Common Threat Vectors – CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 – 2.2**

- **Message-based**:
    
    - **Email**: Attackers send phishing emails with malicious links or attachments.
    - **Short Message Service (SMS)**: Smishing attacks attempt to lure users into clicking harmful links.
    - **Instant Messaging (IM)**: Attackers use direct messages to engage in social engineering and phishing.
- **Image-based**:
    
    - Attackers embed malicious code in **SVG files**, which can execute scripts when viewed in a browser.
- **File-based**:
    
    - **Executable Files**: Malicious executables can be disguised within normal-looking files.
    - **PDFs**: Attackers hide malware in Adobe PDFs, leveraging embedded scripts.
    - **Compressed Files (ZIP, RAR)**: Malware is concealed within archive files to avoid detection.
    - **Office Documents**: Macros in Microsoft Office documents can execute malicious commands.
    - **Browser Extensions**: Malicious add-ins compromise user systems.
- **Voice Call**:
    
    - **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**: Attackers impersonate trusted entities over the phone to extract sensitive information.
    - **Spam over VoIP**: Automated calls and scams targeting victims.
    - **War Dialing**: Attackers scan for active phone lines connected to systems.
    - **Denial-of-Service via Calls**: Disrupting communications using mass call flooding.
- **Removable Device**:
    
    - **USB Drives**: Used to deliver malware, steal data, or emulate keyboards for unauthorized commands.
    - **Air-Gapped Attacks**: Attackers use USB devices to compromise isolated networks.
- **Vulnerable Software**:
    
    - **Client-based vs. Agentless**:
        - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in installed software (client-based).
        - Web-based applications (agentless) are at risk if the central server is compromised.
- **Unsupported Systems and Applications**:
    
    - Legacy systems that no longer receive security patches pose a significant risk.
- **Unsecure Networks**:
    
    - **Wireless**:
        - Weak protocols (e.g., WEP, WPA, WPA2) allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
        - Rogue access points pose security risks.
    - **Wired**:
        - Attackers leverage misconfigured network settings or unmonitored devices.
    - **Bluetooth**:
        - Attackers exploit poorly secured Bluetooth connections for reconnaissance or data theft.
- **Open Service Ports**:
    
    - Attackers exploit open ports to gain unauthorized access, especially on web servers (e.g., TCP 80, TCP 443).
    - Misconfigured applications can create security loopholes.
- **Default Credentials**:
    
    - Devices with factory-set usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin) are easy targets for attackers.
- **Supply Chain**:
    
    - **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: Attackers compromise MSPs to infiltrate client systems.
    - **Vendors & Suppliers**:
        - Attackers target third-party contractors with network access (e.g., Target’s 2013 breach via an HVAC vendor).
        - **Counterfeit Hardware**: Malicious firmware in fake networking equipment introduces security risks.

### **1\. Phishing**

- **Definition**: A social engineering attack where attackers use emails, messages, or other communication methods to trick users into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or financial details.
- **Example from Text**: The attacker sent a fake email pretending to be from Rackspace, urging the victim to confirm their email. The phishing email contained a malicious link leading to a fraudulent login page designed to steal credentials.
- **Signs of Phishing**:
    - Suspicious sender addresses
    - Poor grammar and formatting
    - Urgent action required (e.g., "Confirm your account now!")
    - Links that don’t match legitimate URLs

### **2\. Vishing (Voice Phishing)**

- **Definition**: A phishing attack conducted over the phone, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to extract sensitive information.
- **Example from Text**: An attacker calls pretending to be from Visa, claiming there’s an issue with an automated payment, and requests credit card details.
- **Common Vishing Scenarios**:
    - Fake tech support calls (e.g., "I'm from Microsoft, your computer is infected.")
    - Fake bank representatives asking for account details
    - IRS or government scams threatening legal action

* * *

### **3\. Smishing (SMS Phishing)**

- **Definition**: A phishing attack using text messages (SMS) to trick victims into clicking malicious links or revealing sensitive information.
- **Example from Text**: A fake USPS message claiming that a package is undeliverable due to an incorrect address, with a malicious link requesting login details.
- **Common Smishing Scenarios**:
    - Fake bank alerts about unauthorized transactions
    - Delivery service scams (e.g., FedEx, USPS, DHL)
    - Fake lottery or prize winnings requiring immediate action

### **4\. Misinformation/Disinformation**

- **Definition**: Spreading false information, either unintentionally (**misinformation**) or intentionally (**disinformation**), to mislead or manipulate people.
- **Example from Text**: Attackers create fake social media accounts to spread false political or social narratives, amplifying them through likes, shares, and engagement.
- **How It Works**:
    1.  Attackers create fake social media accounts.
    2.  They post misleading content.
    3.  Fake accounts like and share the content to boost visibility.
    4.  Real users see and further share the false information.
    5.  Mainstream media picks up the topic, spreading misinformation on a larger scale.

### **5\. Impersonation**

- **Definition**: Attackers pretend to be someone they’re not to gain trust and extract sensitive information.
- **Example from Text**: Scammers call pretending to be from the company’s IT help desk, requesting passwords to "fix" an issue.
- **Common Impersonation Scenarios**:
    - Fake IT support asking for login credentials
    - Fake executives requesting urgent financial transfers
    - Fake government officials claiming tax issues or benefits eligibility

### **8\. Watering Hole Attack**

- **Definition**: A cyberattack where hackers compromise a website frequently visited by a target organization, injecting malware to infect visitors.
- **Example from Text**: Attackers compromised financial regulatory websites (e.g., Polish Financial Supervision Authority) to infect banking organizations visiting the sites.
- **How It Works**:
    1.  Attackers study the victim’s browsing habits.
    2.  They hack and inject malware into a trusted third-party website.
    3.  Victims visit the compromised site and unknowingly download malware.
- **Real-World Use**: Nation-state attackers often use watering hole attacks to target government agencies and corporations.
