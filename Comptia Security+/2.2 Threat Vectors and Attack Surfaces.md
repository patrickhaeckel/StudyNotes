### **Common Threat Vectors – CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 – 2.2**

- **Message-based**:
    
    - **Email**: Attackers send phishing emails with malicious links or attachments.
    - **Short Message Service (SMS)**: Smishing attacks attempt to lure users into clicking harmful links.
    - **Instant Messaging (IM)**: Attackers use direct messages to engage in social engineering and phishing.
- **Image-based**:
    
    - Attackers embed malicious code in **SVG files**, which can execute scripts when viewed in a browser.
- **File-based**:
    
    - **Executable Files**: Malicious executables can be disguised within normal-looking files.
    - **PDFs**: Attackers hide malware in Adobe PDFs, leveraging embedded scripts.
    - **Compressed Files (ZIP, RAR)**: Malware is concealed within archive files to avoid detection.
    - **Office Documents**: Macros in Microsoft Office documents can execute malicious commands.
    - **Browser Extensions**: Malicious add-ins compromise user systems.
- **Voice Call**:
    
    - **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**: Attackers impersonate trusted entities over the phone to extract sensitive information.
    - **Spam over VoIP**: Automated calls and scams targeting victims.
    - **War Dialing**: Attackers scan for active phone lines connected to systems.
    - **Denial-of-Service via Calls**: Disrupting communications using mass call flooding.
- **Removable Device**:
    
    - **USB Drives**: Used to deliver malware, steal data, or emulate keyboards for unauthorized commands.
    - **Air-Gapped Attacks**: Attackers use USB devices to compromise isolated networks.
- **Vulnerable Software**:
    
    - **Client-based vs. Agentless**:
        - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in installed software (client-based).
        - Web-based applications (agentless) are at risk if the central server is compromised.
- **Unsupported Systems and Applications**:
    
    - Legacy systems that no longer receive security patches pose a significant risk.
- **Unsecure Networks**:
    
    - **Wireless**:
        - Weak protocols (e.g., WEP, WPA, WPA2) allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
        - Rogue access points pose security risks.
    - **Wired**:
        - Attackers leverage misconfigured network settings or unmonitored devices.
    - **Bluetooth**:
        - Attackers exploit poorly secured Bluetooth connections for reconnaissance or data theft.
- **Open Service Ports**:
    
    - Attackers exploit open ports to gain unauthorized access, especially on web servers (e.g., TCP 80, TCP 443).
    - Misconfigured applications can create security loopholes.
- **Default Credentials**:
    
    - Devices with factory-set usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin) are easy targets for attackers.
- **Supply Chain**:
    
    - **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: Attackers compromise MSPs to infiltrate client systems.
    - **Vendors & Suppliers**:
        - Attackers target third-party contractors with network access (e.g., Target’s 2013 breach via an HVAC vendor).
        - **Counterfeit Hardware**: Malicious firmware in fake networking equipment introduces security risks.
