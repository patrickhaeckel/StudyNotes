### **Segmentation and Access Control**

- **Segmentation**:
    
    - Dividing networks into smaller parts for better security and performance.
    - Includes physical, logical (VLANs), and virtual segmentation.
    - Used for compliance, such as PCI DSS, to separate sensitive data.
- **Access Control - Access Control List (ACL) - Permissions**:
    
    - ACLs define rules to allow or block traffic based on IP, ports, or users.
    - Can be implemented in network devices and operating systems.
    - Permissions define user access rights to files, folders, and systems.
- **Application Allow List**:
    
    - Restricts application execution to pre-approved programs.
    - Helps prevent malware by blocking unauthorized software.
    - Uses methods like hashes, digital signatures, and path-based rules.

### **Mitigation Techniques**

- **Patching**:
    
    - Regular updates to fix vulnerabilities in OS, applications, and firmware.
    - Includes automated patching for home users and controlled patch testing in enterprises.
    - Emergency patches deployed for critical threats.
- **Encryption**:
    
    - Protects data at rest and in transit using cryptographic techniques.
    - File-level encryption (EFS in Windows) and full disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault).
    - Application-level encryption ensures security regardless of system encryption.
- **Monitoring**:
    
    - Continuous logging of system and network activities to detect threats.
    - Includes SIEM solutions for centralized log analysis and threat detection.
    - Used in firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and authentication logs.
- **Least Privilege**:
    
    - Restricts user permissions to only whatâ€™s necessary for their role.
    - Reduces attack surface by limiting access to sensitive data and systems.
    - Temporary privilege escalation when necessary, then revoked after use.
- **Configuration Enforcement**:
    
    - Ensures systems comply with security policies before granting access.
    - Includes posture assessments checking OS versions, patches, and security settings.
    - Non-compliant devices quarantined or given restricted network access.
- **Decommissioning**:
    
    - Properly retiring devices to prevent unauthorized data access.
    - **Sanitization for Reuse**: Secure deletion methods ensure no recoverable data remains.
    - **Physical Destruction**: Shredding, pulverizing, or destroying drives containing sensitive data.
- **Isolation**
    
    - Prevents direct communication between certain systems to enhance security.
    - Example: Users should not directly access a database server; instead, they interact with an application server, which then communicates with the database.
    - Firewalls, ACLs, and network segmentation help enforce isolation.
    - Used to contain security threats by limiting access between critical systems.

### **Hardening Techniques**

- **Encryption**:
    
    - Encrypting files, folders, or entire drives using **Windows Encrypting File System (EFS)** or **Full Disk Encryption (FDE)** like **BitLocker** or **FileVault**.
    - Encrypting network traffic using **VPN** or **HTTPS** for secure communication.
- **Installation of Endpoint Protection**:
    
    - Using **antivirus, anti-malware, and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** to monitor, detect, and respond to threats.
    - EDR uses **behavioral analysis, machine learning, and process monitoring** for advanced security.
- **Host-based Firewall**:
    
    - **Software-based firewalls** that allow or disallow traffic on a system.
    - Can block unknown or unauthorized processes and be centrally managed.
- **Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)**:
    
    - Monitors inbound traffic and **blocks malicious actions based on signatures, heuristics, or behavioral analysis**.
    - Detects buffer overflow attacks, registry changes, and unauthorized file modifications.
- **Disabling Ports/Protocols**:
    
    - Closing unnecessary **open ports** on servers and workstations to reduce attack surfaces.
    - Tools like **Nmap** can scan for open ports.
    - Firewalls and next-generation firewalls help enforce port-based restrictions.
- **Default Password Changes**:
    
    - Changing default credentials on routers, switches, firewalls, and management consoles.
    - Implementing **multifactor authentication (MFA) or centralized authentication** for added security.
- **Removal of Unnecessary Software**:
    
    - Uninstalling unused applications to reduce vulnerabilities.
    - Keeping software **updated with security patches** to protect against known threats.
