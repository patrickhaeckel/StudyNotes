### **Secure Baselines - Establish - Deploy - Maintain**

Security baselines ensure consistent protection for applications and systems.

- **Establishing Baselines**
    
    - Define security configurations for applications, operating systems, and network devices.
    - Utilize vendor-provided templates (e.g., Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit) for initial guidance.
- **Deploying Baselines**
    
    - Implement configurations across systems using tools like Active Directory Group Policy or Mobile Device Management (MDM).
    - Automate processes for scalable deployment to hundreds or thousands of devices.
- **Maintaining Baselines**
    
    - Regularly audit to ensure settings remain compliant.
    - Update configurations for new vulnerabilities, application changes, or operating system upgrades.
    - Resolve conflicts between multiple vendor-recommended baselines by testing and prioritizing best practices.

### **Hardening Targets**

- **Mobile Devices**  
    Hardening mobile devices involves patching vulnerabilities with regular updates provided by manufacturers. Device segmentation ensures a logical division between personal and company data, protecting each independently. Using Mobile Device Management (MDM), organizations can enforce security policies, manage app deployments, and monitor device compliance. Security measures include enforcing screen locks, PINs, and encryption for data protection.
- **Workstations**  
    Workstation hardening includes applying operating system and software updates, removing unused applications, and enabling security features like antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). Organizations should configure accounts with least privilege, ensure complex passwords, and monitor for vulnerabilities.
- **Switches and Routers**  
    Switches and routers operate on specialized embedded systems requiring unique hardening practices. Security measures include changing default credentials, implementing centralized authentication, and applying manufacturer-provided patches. Limiting unnecessary services and securing access through firewalls enhance device security.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**  
    Hardening cloud systems focuses on securing access through least privilege configurations and implementing EDR for attack detection. Backups to separate cloud providers ensure disaster recovery readiness. Administrative workstations must be hardened to safeguard the sensitive access they provide.
- **Servers**  
    Securing servers involves regular updates, enforcing password policies, and disabling unused accounts. Employing least privilege, network segmentation, and EDR ensures protection from unauthorized access and malware.
- **ICS/SCADA Systems**  
    Industrial systems use air-gapped, isolated networks for security. Real-time monitoring and limited external access prevent unauthorized control. Ensuring updates for these systems is critical due to their unique vulnerabilities.
- **Embedded Systems**  
    Devices like smart TVs or appliances operate on purpose-built systems, often with limited security measures. Hardening requires patching as soon as updates are available and segregating networks to limit potential exploits.
- **RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems)**  
    RTOS operates on strict timelines, critical for industrial, military, or automotive applications. They must run with minimal services and be isolated from other systems. Host-based security and network segmentation enhance protection.
- **IoT Devices**  
    IoT security includes rapid patching for firmware updates, network segmentation, and firewall configurations to prevent exploitation. Due to the lack of built-in security expertise from manufacturers, proactive measures are necessary.
