### **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**

- **Confidentiality**:
    
    - Ensures sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
    - Methods:
        - **Encryption**: Protects data during transit or storage.
        - **Access Controls**: Limits data access based on roles or permissions.
        - **Authentication Factors**: Multi-factor authentication to validate user identity.
- **Integrity**:
    
    - Guarantees that data remains unaltered and authentic.
    - Methods:
        - **Hashing**: Verifies that data hasn't been tampered with.
        - **Digital Signatures**: Ensures the sender's authenticity and data integrity.
        - **Certificates**: Provides assurance during data transfers.
- **Availability**:
    
    - Ensures data and systems are accessible when needed.
    - Methods:
        - **Fault Tolerance**: Redundancy in components to prevent system failures.
        - **Regular Updates and Patches**: Maintains system stability and closes vulnerabilities.

### **Non-repudiation**

- **Proof of Origin and Integrity**:
    
    - Ensures the sender's identity and verifies the data remains unchanged.
    - Methods:
        - **Hashing**: Confirms data integrity through unique "fingerprints."
        - **Digital Signatures**: Encrypts hashes with private keys to confirm sender identity.
        - **Public/Private Key Pairs**: Validates the authenticity of the digital signature.
- **Practical Use**:
    
    - Digital signatures on documents ensure authenticity and prevent denial of sending.

### **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**

- **Authenticating People**:
    
    - Verifies a user's identity using credentials.
    - Methods:
        - **Passwords**: Basic authentication method.
        - **Certificates**: Device or user-specific credentials for additional security.
        - **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Combines different factors (e.g., passwords and biometric scans).
- **Authenticating Systems**:
    
    - Confirms device legitimacy before network access.
    - Methods:
        - **Certificates**: Issued and signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
        - **Verification Process**: Ensures systems comply with security requirements.
- **Authorization Models**:
    
    - Determines the level of access granted to users or systems.
    - Methods:
        - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions based on user roles.
        - **Group Authorization**: Simplifies access management by grouping users with similar needs.
        - **Scalable Models**: Abstract user access from specific resources to streamline permissions.
- **Accounting**:
    
    - Logs user activity for auditing and tracking.
    - Records:
        - Login times.
        - Data accessed.
        - Logout timestamps.

### **Gap Analysis**

- **Gap Analysis Objective**:
    - Evaluates current vs. desired security posture.
    - **Steps**:
        - Baseline establishment: e.g., NIST SP 800-171 or ISO/IEC 27001.
        - Analyze people, processes, and technology.
        - Identify weaknesses in existing systems.
        - Create a comprehensive comparison report (current vs. target state).
    - **Outcome**:
        - Detailed plans to achieve desired security baselines.

### **Zero Trust – Control Plane**

- **Adaptive Identity**:
    
    - **Definition**: Adjusts security requirements based on context.
        - Example: Cross-verifying user credentials with IP location.
    - **Use Case**: High-risk IP prompts multi-factor authentication.
- **Threat Scope Reduction**:
    
    - **Objective**: Minimizes exposure by segregating network zones.
        - Example: Restricting access between untrusted and trusted zones.
- **Policy-Driven Access Control**:
    
    - **Definition**: Access is based on predefined rules and evaluations.
        - Example: Users from untrusted zones must verify multiple identity factors.
- **Policy Administrator**:
    
    - **Role**: Mediates between the enforcement point and the decision engine.
        - Example: Delivers credentials/tokens based on decisions.
- **Policy Engine**:
    
    - **Functionality**: Evaluates requests against security policies.
        - Decision outcomes: Grant, deny, or revoke access.

### **Zero Trust – Data Plane**

- **Implicit Trust Zones**:
    
    - **Definition**: Zones where communication between trusted areas does not require additional verification.
        - Example: Internal office network to a secured data center.
- **Subject/System**:
    
    - **Scope**: Includes users, devices, and processes.
        - Example: Application requests subject to access controls.
- **Policy Enforcement Point**:
    
    - **Description**: Acts as the network's "gatekeeper."
        - Example: Inspects traffic and enforces access rules.

### **Physical Security**

- **Bollards**:
    
    - Physical barriers used to block vehicles while allowing pedestrian access.
    - Often brightly colored for visibility and to denote high-security areas.
- **Access Control Vestibule**:
    
    - A secure entry area where access is regulated by locking mechanisms and badge systems.
    - Ensures only one person or a controlled group passes through at a time.
- **Fencing**:
    
    - Transparent or opaque fences to restrict unauthorized access.
    - High fences with additional deterrents like razor wire for enhanced security.
- **Video Surveillance**:
    
    - Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) with motion detection and object recognition capabilities.
    - Provides 24/7 monitoring and records events for future reference.
- **Security Guard**:
    
    - Personnel for validating entry and providing physical protection.
    - Often paired with two-person integrity for checks and balances.
- **Access Badge**:
    
    - Identification cards with user information for electronic access and logging.
    - Visible at all times to denote authorization.
- **Lighting**:
    
    - Illumination to deter unauthorized access and enhance camera functionality.
    - Infrared lighting for better visibility in dark areas.
- **Sensors**:
    
    - **Infrared**: Detects motion by sensing heat.
    - **Pressure**: Alerts based on force changes in specific areas.
    - **Microwave**: Covers larger areas to detect movement.
    - **Ultrasonic**: Uses sound wave reflections for motion and collision detection.

### **Deception and Disruption Technology**

- **Honeypot**:
    
    - Simulated systems to attract attackers and analyze their techniques.
    - Commonly used to study automated attacks.
- **Honeynet**:
    
    - A network of interconnected honeypots simulating real infrastructure.
    - Keeps attackers occupied while gathering intelligence.
- **Honeyfile**:
    
    - Fake files like "passwords.txt" designed to lure attackers.
    - Alerts when accessed to detect unauthorized activity.
- **Honeytoken**:
    
    - Traceable fake data such as API credentials or email addresses.
    - Identifies sources of leaks when the data appears elsewhere.
