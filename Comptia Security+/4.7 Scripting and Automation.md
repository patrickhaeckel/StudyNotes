- ### **Use Cases of Automation and Scripting**:
    
    - **User Provisioning**: Automates account creation, group assignments, and resource access.
    - **Resource Provisioning**: Configures infrastructure like routers, firewalls, and cloud resources automatically.
    - **Guard Rails**: Implements automated verification to prevent critical mistakes, such as accidental file deletions.
    - **Security Groups**: Adds, removes, or monitors group memberships and sends alerts for changes.
    - **Ticket Creation**: Converts help desk emails into tickets and assigns them appropriately.
    - **Escalation**: Automatically escalates unresolved issues to the next support level.
    - **Enabling/Disabling Services and Access**: Turns services on or off based on pre-defined schedules or conditions.
    - **Continuous Integration and Testing**: Automates code deployment and testing for developers.
    - **Integrations and APIs**: Uses scripting to interact programmatically with cloud-based or hardware APIs.

- ### **Benefits**:
    
    - **Efficiency/Time Saving**: Automates repetitive tasks, freeing time for more complex work.
    - **Enforcing Baselines**: Ensures consistent application of security updates and configurations.
    - **Standard Infrastructure Configurations**: Guarantees uniform setups across systems.
    - **Scaling in a Secure Manner**: Integrates security features automatically during scaling.
    - **Employee Retention**: Reduces mundane tasks, increasing job satisfaction.
    - **Reaction Time**: Allows scripts to respond instantly to issues like low disk space.
    - **Workforce Multiplier**: Enhances productivity by automating time-consuming tasks.

- ### **Other Considerations**:
    
    - **Complexity**: Requires significant planning, coding, and testing to integrate systems.
    - **Cost**: Demands investment in development and ongoing maintenance of scripts.
    - **Single Point of Failure**: Over-reliance on scripts can create vulnerabilities if they fail.
    - **Technical Debt**: Poorly written scripts can compound existing problems instead of solving root issues.
    - **Ongoing Supportability**: Scripts need regular updates to align with system and language changes.
