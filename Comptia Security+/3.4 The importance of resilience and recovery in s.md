### **High Availability - Load Balancing vs. Clustering**

High availability ensures continuous system operations by using multiple, redundant systems. **Load balancing** involves a central load balancer distributing requests across multiple servers, ensuring even workloads and automatic exclusion of failed servers. **Server clustering**, on the other hand, allows multiple servers to work as a unified system with shared storage for synchronization. Both approaches ensure uptime but differ in architecture and operation. While clustering requires identical OS configurations, load balancers allow for heterogeneous systems.

### **Site Considerations - Hot, Cold, Warm Sites, Geographic Dispersion**

- **Hot Sites**: Fully equipped and synchronized duplicates of the primary site, enabling immediate failover.
- **Cold Sites**: Bare infrastructure requiring setup and data transfer post-disaster.
- **Warm Sites**: Partially equipped sites requiring additional resources to become operational.
- **Geographic Dispersion**: Locating recovery sites far from primary sites to mitigate regional disasters, though it complicates logistics.

### **Platform Diversity**

Using varied operating systems and platforms reduces vulnerabilities, as exploits are often platform-specific. Combining Windows, Linux, macOS, and other systems minimizes the risk of a single vulnerability compromising the entire infrastructure. This diversity spreads risk and enhances resilience.

### **Multi-Cloud Systems**

Multi-cloud strategies involve leveraging services from multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). This prevents reliance on a single provider, enhancing uptime and mitigating risks from outages or security incidents affecting one provider.

### **Continuity of Operations**

Continuity planning ensures service availability during disruptions. This includes manual failbacks like paper processes for point-of-sale systems or offline credit card approvals. Such plans must be pre-established and actionable during crises.

### **Capacity Planning - People, Technology, Infrastructure**

Capacity planning balances resources to meet demand without overprovisioning.

- **People**: Staffing must match workload demands. Hiring and training need foresight to avoid shortages or redundancies.
- **Technology**: Scalable systems, like load-balanced web servers or multi-instance cloud setups, adjust seamlessly to fluctuations in demand.
- **Infrastructure**: On-premises setups require significant lead time for scaling, whereas cloud solutions offer rapid deployment for high-demand periods. Cloud environments facilitate dynamic scaling but increase costs with usage.
