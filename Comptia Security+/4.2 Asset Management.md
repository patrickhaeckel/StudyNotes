### **Asset Tracking**

- **Central Asset Tracking System**:
    
    - Records asset details and ownership.
    - Differentiates between hardware (capital expenditure) and software (operating expense).
    - Tracks assets throughout their lifecycle, including inventory and deployment.
- **Uses in IT**:
    
    - Help desks utilize asset tracking for troubleshooting.
    - Enables detailed visibility into devices and their components (e.g., CPU, memory).
- **Asset Tagging**:
    
    - Physical tags or barcodes enhance security and identification.

### **Media Sanitization and Physical Destruction**

- **Sanitization for Reuse**:
    
    - **Secure Deletion**: Ensures no recoverable data remains.
    - Used for internal redeployment of devices.
- **Physical Destruction**:
    
    - **Methods**:
        - Shredding or pulverizing.
        - Drilling or hammering the drive platters.
        - Degaussing using strong electromagnetic fields.
        - Incineration for complete destruction.
    - **Certification**:
        - Third-party services provide a Certificate of Destruction for assurance.
