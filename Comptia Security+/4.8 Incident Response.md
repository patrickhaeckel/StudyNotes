### **Incident Response Process**

- **Preparation**:
    - Maintain updated contact lists and communication methods
    - Create incident "go bags" containing specialized hardware and software
    - Gather essential resources:
        - Server documentation
        - Network diagrams
        - Security baselines
        - File hashes of critical files
    - Prepare known-good operating system and application images
    - Establish clear policies and procedures
- **Detection**:
    - Monitor multiple attack vectors and systems
    - Analyze various indicators:
        - Web server logs
        - IPS alerts
        - Antivirus reports
        - Security configuration changes
        - Unusual network traffic patterns
    - Implement continuous monitoring systems
    - Review Microsoft patch release schedules
- **Analysis**:
    - Utilize sandbox environments for testing suspicious activities
    - Evaluate malware behavior in controlled environments
    - Document attack patterns and methods
    - Assess scope and impact of the incident
    - Review affected systems and data
- **Containment**:
    - Implement immediate response to active attacks
    - Isolate affected systems
    - Prevent further system compromise
    - Document containment actions
    - Preserve evidence for investigation
- **Eradication**:
    - Remove malicious software
    - Disable compromised user accounts
    - Address identified vulnerabilities
    - Replace compromised files
    - Implement security patches
- **Recovery**:
    - Restore systems using known-good backups
    - Reinstall operating systems from original media
    - Verify system integrity
    - Monitor for recurring issues
    - Return systems to production
- **Lessons Learned**:
    - Conduct post-incident meetings
    - Document incident timeline
    - Evaluate response effectiveness
    - Identify missed indicators
    - Update procedures based on findings

### **Digital Forensics Process**

- **Legal Hold**:
    - Initiated by legal entities or lawyers
    - Formal document specifying required data retention
    - Managed by data custodians
    - Requires dedicated storage for electronically stored information (ESI)
    - May involve format conversion for proper preservation
- **Chain of Custody**:
    - Ensures data integrity throughout investigation
    - Documents who accessed the evidence
    - Implements digital signatures and hashes
    - Tracks data handling and storage
    - Maintains evidence authenticity
- **Acquisition**:
    - Collects data from multiple sources:
        - System memory and disk drives
        - Firmware and file systems
        - Network devices and firewalls
        - Virtual machine snapshots
    - Gathers supplementary data:
        - Log files
        - Recycle bin contents
        - Browser data
        - Temporary files
    - Follows RFC 3227 guidelines
    - Preserves data in original form
- **Reporting**:
    - Creates comprehensive documentation:
        - Event summary and overview
        - Detailed acquisition steps
        - Data integrity verification
        - Analysis findings
    - Provides factual descriptions
    - Documents conclusions
    - Maintains detailed procedures
- **Preservation**:
    - Creates multiple backup copies
    - Works from copied data
    - Implements special handling for:
        - Mobile devices
        - Encrypted systems
        - Live system collection
    - Follows long-term storage best practices
    - Maintains data integrity
- **E-Discovery**:
    - Focuses on electronic document collection
    - Involves multiple stages:
        - Data collection
        - Preparation
        - Review
        - Interpretation
        - Production
    - Supports forensic investigations
    - Provides raw data for analysis
    - Works alongside formal forensics processes
